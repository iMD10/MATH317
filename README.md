Welcome to the **MATH317: Numerical Methods** repository! This project contains Python implementations of various numerical methods covered in the MATH317 course. Each method is implemented based on the pseudocodes provided during lectures, with clear examples and explanations.

## ðŸ“š Course Topics

This repository includes implementations of the following numerical methods:

- **Bisection Method**: A root-finding technique that repeatedly bisects an interval to converge to a root.
- **Horner's Method**: An efficient way to evaluate polynomials at a given value.
- **Complete Horner's Method**: Extends Horner's method to compute derivatives as well.
- **Newton's Method**: An iterative method for finding successively better approximations to the roots of a function.
- **Polynomial Operations**: Basic operations like addition, multiplication, and evaluation of polynomials.
